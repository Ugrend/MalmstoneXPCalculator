## Credits
 - Huge thanks to NanaGrace for their python-based Malmstone XP Calculator, which rubbed all the math on this for me, so I only had to translate it to JS. Original code can be found here: https://replit.com/@NanaGrace/Malmstone-XP-Calculator
 - Awesome Playstation CSS style from https://github.com/98mprice/PSone.css
